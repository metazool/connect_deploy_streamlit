# connect_deploy_streamlit

Minimal, "hello world" test of git-based continuous deployment of Streamlit to Posit Connect.

You can use the [rsconnect](https://docs.posit.co/rsconnect-python/) python client to deploy, but the server side claims you can do a continuous pull from a repository, and it would be nice to set that up and stop thinking about it.

Question here is about how we store credentials for data storage?
